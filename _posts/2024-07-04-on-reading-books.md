Reading is not a go-to leisure for the people of my kind (Computer Scientists, and yes we ARE different), and the casual excuse sounds like : after a whole shift spent decode enormous  lines of text with a rigorous logic that exhausts any mind trying to understand it, "debugging" another text -that happen to be more "nuanced" as it is not intended for binary usage- is just A LOT.  

And they are right. But it doesn't stop here.  

In my opinion, that dramatic explanation is an alibi trying to cover other factors, mainly the spreading of "an Effectiveness cult" among engineers, making room for questions such as :  

Why should I get trough 700 pages -with 90 seconds in each- in order to understand 2 quotes and 3 ideas ? Doesn't the mantra of ''Project Based Learning' is the right way to understand things ? Why shouldn't I approach life as a new Programming Language, practice first and theorise later ?  

Valid Questions. But only if you consider Textbooks equal to novel because the two are written in paper having cover on it.  

Something like : a ThinkPad is just like an iPad in every way because the two has screens.   

## On Texts and books :

Textbooks are not meant to be read, but to be studied.  
Books (the good ones) are meant to be re-read.

In another way, a textbook is written with such a way that it is impossible to go through 30 pages a day without nearing insanity (or a deadline). With first an introduction, then listing a set of rules with proofs for each, the information in a Textbook is for  **Comprehension** and **Memorization**, it is meant to be collected and linked with other information in order to form a quick search/dequeue when presented a problem that require your expertise, and this can be done with just one long, exhaustive read, for the information can then be summarized for quicker retrieval.  

But books, either novels or a pure intellectual work are written to be-reread, because the information contained in it is for **Reflection** and **Engagement**, where the Information is to be decomposed, examined closely, and recomposed following a set of thought pattern that the reader acquire through his life and experiences.  

And this cannot be achieved with a single read.  
Why ? Because you will have different "Prompts" each time.  


## LLMs and Books, An Analogy

It is of non-use to ask a person interacting daily with computer internals about how many times ChatGPT saved their skin, for it is innumerable.  
And there is something those persons agree on : the more you know, the more useful an LLM will be, because you will know exactly how to guide it to give you the output you really need, or put differently : you will ask better questions.  

It is the same for books.  

Each time a proper book is held, one should have a set of questions -Implicitly or explicitly- that he wants them answered through his reading, and the better the question, the better answers will be, so with the experienced accumulated with other readings and experiences that pushes new questions, rereading the book, or re-prompting it is imperative to gain a deeper understanding of the wisdom contained in it, and to unlock better interactions and more polished "modules of thought" from the book.  

And there is more.  

The beautiful thing is that the questions/prompts you propose to books do not need context, because answering question in a given field is very common by another one, an example is the *"electrical engineer Claude Shannon, who launched the Information Age thanks to a philosophy course he took to fulfil a requirement at the University of Michigan. In it, he was exposed to the work of self-taught nineteenth-century English logician George Boole, who assigned a value of 1 to true statements and 0 to false statements and showed that logic problems could be solved like math equations. It resulted in absolutely nothing of practical importance until seventy years after Boole passed away, when Shannon did a summer internship at AT&T’s Bell Labs research facility. There he recognized that he could combine telephone call routing technology with Boole’s logic system to encode and transmit any type of information electronically" (Range, Why Generalists triumph in a specialized world : p38)*.


Ah yes, Books do not charge for you asking too.  

## Domain Expansion, The Right Way

So why would you read things outside your field of experience ?  

David Epstein answered this question in his marvellous work : Range - Why Generalists triumph in a specialized world, but in short, 
- it is because you will first and foremost benefit from it in your actual work, discovering old ideas that could apply to the problem in your hand, or importing something from a complete foreign field as a breakthrough in yours (see examples in the book, where Kaggle competition are solved by non-tech with the highest score).
- Because either you do it, or you will be used a tool for things that you may hold values going against them, so you could be remembered as "the robot with flesh", who executed orders without looking at what is he doing to the world, because it was too much to learn how the latter worked.
- Because by reading, your mind will engage of wisdom worth of hundreds of human lives, leaving you optimising your time, energy and happiness to in the best spot.

Now, let me ask you a question, what if we approached a Fantasy book with Computer Science questions?
Thats what we will see, when disscussing a book that i owe reading it to a deer freind.
